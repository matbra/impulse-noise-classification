# An impulse noise detector in MATLAB
**An algorithm to detect impulse noise in audio signals**

The functionality of the method is described in an article that hopefully will be published soon. An accompanying website can be found [here](http://matbra.tk).

The detection algorithm uses a music beat detector that is contained in this repository as a git submodule.
