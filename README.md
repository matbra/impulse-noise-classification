# An Impulse Noise Classifier in MATLAB
**An algorithm to classify impulse noise in audio signals**

The functionality of the method is described in the article [1] that was published in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society. An accompanying website with example signals can be found [here](http://matbra.org).

The classification algorithm optionally uses a music beat detector that is contained in this repository as a git submodule.
